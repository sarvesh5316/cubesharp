# cubesharp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the code for a Cubesharp app. To run the app, follow these steps:

# Install Android Studio on your computer.
# Clone this repository to your computer.
# Open the project in Android Studio.
# Select the Run/Debug Configuration for the app.
# Select the device or emulator that you want to run the app on.
# Click the Run button.

If you are running the app on an emulator, you may need to create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) first. To do this, open the Android Studio Device Manager and click the Create Virtual Device button.

Once the app is running, you can interact with it just like any other Android app.

# Additional notes:

1 If you are making changes to the app code, you may need to rebuild the app before running it. To do this, click the Build menu and select Rebuild Project.
2 If you are having trouble running the app, try the following:
3 Make sure that you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
4 Make sure that the device or emulator that you are running the app on is compatible with the app.
5 Check the Android Studio logs for any errors.
